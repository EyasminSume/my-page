  <p class="aa">If you love food and want to start your own small business, you've possibly done some research into how to open a restaurant. After all launching a restaurant is one of the most common routes to entrepreneurship in the United States. According to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant workers make up 10% of the United States workforce. What's more, projected sales in the restaurant industry are projected to reach $863 billion in 2019.
  
      But starting a restaurant means entering a highly competitive space. There are over 1 million restaurant locations in the United States, and 60% of restaurants fail within the first year. So how do you stand out, and build something that will last?
      
      In this guide, we'll show you What kind of restaurant do you want to run? This is known as your “elevator pitch,” and it’s something you’ll repeat over and over and over to friends, family, customers, lenders, investors, and just about everyone else.
  
      Who is your restaurant for? This is called your target market—the group of people whom your restaurant is meant to serve.

      
     <em class="aa"> Who are your competitors? It helps to understand who you are competing against in your market and how their restaurants are similar and different than yours.
      
      Where will your restaurant be located? Having an expensive steak house in the middle of a low-income neighborhood probably won't work out.</em>
      
      
      What is your value proposition? What makes your restaurant different from the competition?
      
      How will customers find your restaurant? Will you market your business through word-of-mouth, paid advertising, social media, or another method? We recommend leveraging popular review apps like Yelp, OpenTable, and Resy to allow customers to find and review your restaurant or even book a reservation online.
      
      What resources will your restaurant need? Take the time now to list out all the one-time and recurring expenses you’re likely to incur as part of your cost of doing business—leaving no stone unturned.
      
      How will your restaurant make money? Your business model determines how your restaurant will generate revenue, cover expenses, and eventually make more money than it spends.
      
      How long will it take for your restaurant to turn a profit? Use a revenue forecast to determine how long it will take to recuperate your initial investment, break even, and run a profitable business.
      
      What are you not willing to compromise on? What values are most important to you, both personally and as a business? What are your non-negotiables? This will help you make critical business decisions down the road.
      
      What is your staffing plan? Your head chef, friends, and family will be the place to start looking for stand-up, smart, reliable pehow to open a restaurant and avoid the common mistakes that plague most new restaurateurs<br>
